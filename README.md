# structureMapDependencyInjection


"Dependency injection" (DI) in object-oriented computer programming is a technique that indicates to a part of a program which other parts it can use, i.e. to supply an external dependency (i.e. a reference) to a software component. In technical terms, it is a design pattern that separates behavior from dependency resolution, thus decoupling highly dependent components. "StructureMap" is a "Dependency Injection"/"Inversion of Control" tool for .NET that can be used to improve the architectural qualities of an object oriented system by reducing the mechanical costs of good design techniques. StructureMap can enable looser coupling between classes and their dependencies, improve the testability of a class structure, and provide generic flexibility mechanisms. Used judiciously, StructureMap can greatly enhance the opportunities for code reuse by minimizing direct coupling between classes and configuration mechanisms.
